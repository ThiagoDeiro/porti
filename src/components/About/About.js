                <p className="about-text">I am a Junior Front-End Developer with a background in law and customer service. I came upon coding with a head full of inspiration, having seen my previous workplaces transformed by web-based technologies.
                After school, I found myself going down the law path to follow my family's footsteps, but I never gave up on my interest and continued taking online courses, attending events and meetups, and kept up-to-date with the latest technology trends.
                I am looking to join an innovative organisation that fosters employee growth and has a great team culture. I believe that with my skills, my adaptability and my people-focused work ethic, I will be an asset to your team.
